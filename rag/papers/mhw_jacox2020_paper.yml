  Abstract

  Thermal displacement by marine heatwaves
  Michael G. Jacox1,2,3 ✉, Michael A. Alexander2, Steven J. Bograd1,3 & James D. Scott2,4
  Marine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete but prolonged periods of anomalously warm 
  ocean temperatures—can drastically alter ocean ecosystems, with profound ecological 
  and socioeconomic impacts1–8. Considerable effort has been directed at understanding 
  the patterns, drivers and trends of MHWs globally9–11. Typically, MHWs are 
  characterized on the basis of their intensity and persistence at a given location—an 
  approach that is particularly relevant for corals and other sessile organisms that must 
  endure increased temperatures. However, many ecologically and commercially 
  important marine species respond to environmental disruptions by relocating to 
  favourable habitats, and dramatic range shifts of mobile marine species are among the 
  conspicuous impacts of MHWs1,4,12,13. Whereas spatial temperature shifts have been 
  studied extensively in the context of long-term warming trends14–18, they are 
  unaccounted for in existing global MHW analyses. Here we introduce thermal 
  displacement as a metric that characterizes MHWs by the spatial shifts of surface 
  temperature contours, instead of by local temperature anomalies, and use an 
  observation-based global sea surface temperature dataset to calculate thermal 
  displacements for all MHWs from 1982 to 2019. We show that thermal displacements 
  during MHWs vary from tens to thousands of kilometres across the world’s oceans and 
  do not correlate spatially with MHW intensity. Furthermore, short-term thermal 
  displacements during MHWs are of comparable magnitude to century-scale shifts 
  inferred from warming trends, although their global spatial patterns are very 
  different. These results expand our understanding of MHWs and their potential 
  impacts on marine species, revealing which regions are most susceptible to thermal 
  displacement, and how such shifts may change under projected ocean warming. The 
  findings also highlight the need for marine resource management to account for 
  MHW-driven spatial shifts, which are of comparable scale to those associated with 
  long-term climate change and are already happening.

  Overview (part, about definition and methodology)
  ... MHWs have been defined and characterized on the basis of the local amplitude and 
  persistence of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies... To account for this critical 
  dimension of MHW impacts, which is not captured by local temperature anomaly metrics, 
  we introduce and quantify the ‘thermal displacement’ associated with MHWs across the globe. 
  Thermal displacement is the minimum distance that   must be travelled away from an MHW to 
  track constant SST. It is related to climate velocity (the rate at which isotherms move 
  across the Earth’s surface under climate change) but is applied on an event scale in which 
  the magnitude of the displacement, not the rate of change, is of greatest interest...
  we use monthly SST anomalies from version 2 of the NOAA 0.25° Optimum Interpolation SST 
  product to explore historical (1982–2019) spatial and temporal patterns of thermal 
  displacement throughout the world’s oceans, and then quantify the future change 
  in these displacements associated with projected warming from an ensemble of climate models...

  ... Several MHWs have received extensive scientific and public atten-
  tion in the past decade, and can be viewed through the lens of thermal 
  displacement. In the Northeast Pacific, 2014–2016 brought an unprec-
  edented MHW initially situated offshore (‘the Blob’)20 that later evolved 
  into an arc warming pattern spanning the North American west coast24. 
  During this event, thermal displacements exceeded 700 km in the Gulf 
  of Alaska and along the US west coast. Similar displacements were 
  generated in 2005 by the delayed upwelling season and consequent 
  warming... The 2012 Northwest Atlantic MHW... was the 
  most intense seen in the region in 30 years, and drove commercially 
  valuable species to rapidly shift poleward by hundreds of kilometres...

  Methods
  Defining marine heatwaves
  Historical SST observations for the 1982–2019 period were obtained from 
  the NOAA 0.25° Optimum Interpolation SST, version 2 (OISSTv238,39), 
  which has been used previously for MHW detection9. We masked out 
  regions where OISSTv2 ice concentrations were greater than zero for 
  more than 15 days in a month. MHWs were identified on the basis of 
  methodology adapted from Hobday et al.21. For each grid cell we cal-
  culated time series of SST anomalies relative to the 1982–2011 clima-
  tology and classified MHWs as periods with SST anomalies above a 
  seasonally varying 90th-percentile threshold (Extended Data Fig. 5). 
  Our analysis differs from those used in some other studies in that we 
  used monthly averaged SST rather than daily data, and we detrended 
  the SST anomalies to distinguish discrete, transient MHWs from the 
  long-term warming signal31. Although we believe that the choices to use 
  monthly data and to detrend anomalies are the most appropriate for 
  this analysis, we are aware of the lack of consensus on these aspects of 
  MHW definition and detection. Therefore, in section ‘Justification for 
  MHW definition and implications for this study’ we outline the moti-
  vations for our choices and we compare our results to those based on 
  daily data and those calculated without removing the warming trend. 
  Neither the monthly data frequency nor the detrending qualitatively 
  affect our results.
  Calculating thermal displacement
  For each MHW (that is, every month characterized as an MHW in each 
  grid cell), the climatological SST (SSTCLIM) for that location and time 
  was first determined by subtracting the detrended SST anomaly from 
  the observed SST. Thermal displacement was then calculated as the 
  great circle distance to the nearest grid cell with SST equal to or less 
  than SSTCLIM (Extended Data Fig. 5). Thermal displacements were con-
  strained so that unrealistic paths through land barriers (for example, 
  entering or exiting inland seas, crossing continents between ocean 
  basins) did not alter the large-scale patterns presented here. However, 
  paths that interacted with land were allowed if they represented realistic 
  displacements (for example, along the California coast in Fig. 3a); in 
  such cases, the reported thermal displacements underestimate the 
  true distance travelled by an oceanic pathway. Regions for which a 
  displaced thermal habitat is sometimes unreachable include inland 
  seas as well as gulfs, bays, and seas that are bounded by land masses 
  on the poleward side. We note that an alternative approach drawing 
  on the climate velocity literature would be to calculate the thermal 
  displacement as the MHW intensity divided by the local SST gradient. 
  This approach is appropriate for climate velocity, a local rate of change, 
  but fails for MHW-driven thermal displacements that depend not only 
  on the local SST gradient but also on the broader spatial structure of 
  SST and locations of land masses.

  Justification for MHW definition and implications for this study
  Here we discuss the justifications for using monthly data and detrend-
  ing SST anomalies, and the implications of those choices for the results 
  of the study. We note at the outset that they do not qualitatively affect 
  our findings; using monthly instead of daily data alters the frequency 
  and duration of identified MHWs (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data 
  Fig. 6), but MHW intensities are only slightly reduced and impacts on 
  thermal displacements are negligible (Extended Data Table 1, Extended 
  Data Fig. 7). Similarly, using a fixed 1982–2011 baseline climatology 
  instead of detrending the historical SST data generally increases MHW 
  intensities and thermal displacements, most notably in the high north-
  ern latitudes, but produces no consequential changes in our conclu-
  sions (Extended Data Figs. 8–10).
  The recommended MHW definition of Hobday et al. has been 
  adopted by many in general terms, although details of the methodol-
  ogy have been altered depending on the particular aims and constraints 
  of different studies. For example, Holbrook et al.11 used the 98th per-
  centile as a threshold (instead of the 90th percentile) because “a 90th 
  percentile threshold resulted in too many small events that made it 
  unclear when the main event was taking place”. Using monthly instead 
  of daily data similarly limits identified MHWs to the ‘main events’. Data 
  with monthly resolution and/or coarse spatial resolution have been 
  used for historical analyses and future projections9,10,41, and monthly 
  data are used in forecasts for MHWs and other SST anomalies42–44. With 
  respect to the reference period for defining MHWs, several analyses of 
  long-term MHW trends have used fixed baselines9,10, although other 
  studies have employed detrended anomalies11,41 (we note that these 
  studies using fixed baselines and detrended anomalies share many 
  of the same authors). Thus, modifying the Hobday et al.21 definition 
  is not without precedent; it is a proposal rather than a consensus and 
  indeed the authors state “these metrics can, of course, be modified 
  to suit the specific application”. Below we outline the justifications 
  for our choices in the context of this study, addressing first the use of 
  the monthly data and then the removal of long-term warming trends.
  We chose to use monthly SST data for our analysis for several reasons. 
  (i) The atmospheric heatwave definition requires a minimum three-day 
  event duration21; although Hobday et al.21 note that for MHWs “minor 
  differences to the atmospheric definition (minimum duration and 
  minimum time between events) were implemented because of the 
  naturally longer time scales of ocean variability compared with atmos-
  pheric variability”, the adjustment from three days for the atmosphere 
  to five days for the ocean is not representative of their different scales of 
  variability. The atmosphere has very little memory and is often treated 
  as stochastic, whereas decorrelation timescales in the ocean can range 
  from days to over a year (see ref. 45 and references therein). Thus, we 
  argue that a minimum MHW duration of a month represents a more 
  appropriate scaling relative to the atmospheric heatwave definition. 
  (ii) MHW definitions based on monthly data are more consistent with 
  reported impacts. The MHWs identified as being the most impactful 
  historically have, with few exceptions, lasted at least a month46,47, and 
  although MHWs are generally thought of as rare events, according to 
  daily definitions they happen multiple times per year in most locations. 
  For example, in the Eastern Tropical Pacific we find MHWs once every 
  3–4 years using monthly data, which is consistent with the frequency 
  of El Niño events. By contrast, using daily data with a five-day minimum 
  duration, we find on average 1.2 MHWs per year identified in that region 
  (Extended Data Table 1). (iii) To the extent that thermal displacement 
  can serve as a proxy for distributional shifts of marine species, MHWs 
  must last long enough for those distributional shifts to occur. Such 
  ecological impacts (for example, marine fishes swimming hundreds 
  or thousands of kilometres) will not be realized in a matter of days. 
  (iv) Thermal displacement calculations are much more computationally 
  expensive than calculations of other MHW metrics (for example, inten-
  sity, duration and frequency). In addition to being more appropriate 
  for this analysis for the reasons listed above, the use of monthly data 
  also lowers the computational burden dramatically. Nonetheless, the 
  same methodology can be applied to daily MHW definitions if desired.
  There are physical and ecological arguments for detrending SST 
  anomalies when defining and characterizing MHWs in the presence 
  of a long-term warming trend31. From a physical perspective, we start 
  from the premise that an MHW is, in fact, a wave (or, more precisely, 
  the warmest part of a temperature anomaly wave). Using a fixed base-
  line leads to clear violations of wave property definitions (amplitude/
  intensity, frequency), which are objectively determined relative to a 
  contemporaneous equilibrium position. Furthermore, the proposed 
  qualitative MHW definition of “a discrete prolonged anomalously warm 
  water event”21 is violated when using a fixed baseline in a warming ocean; 
  eventually historical MHW thresholds are permanently exceeded and 
  MHWs are neither discrete (that is, “with well-defined start and end 
  times”21) nor anomalous (given that something that occurs every day 
  is not anomalous).
  Arguments in favour of a fixed baseline for MHWs generally invoke 
  impacts on marine species, specifically that (1) they respond to the total 
  temperature change, not just the variability around the mean, and/or 
  (2) they have evolved in response to historical, not future, conditions. 
  We agree with the argument that the total warming is important for 
  species responses, but that does not mean that all warming is associated 
  with MHWs. When changes in temperature due to the combination of 
  MHWs and long-term warming are of interest, metrics such as cumula-
  tive stress, degree days or threshold exceedance are appropriate48. We 
  also agree with the argument that species have evolved on the basis of 
  past conditions. However, different species respond in different ways, 
  at different thresholds and on different timescales, and their adap-
  tive and evolutionary capacities are similarly disparate in nature and 
  timescale. Thus, although MHW metrics are useful for characterizing 
  marine ecosystem change, no MHW definition will pass the test of being 
  broadly appropriate for marine species responses. As is done for other 
  ecologically important physical ocean phenomena (upwelling for exam-
  ple), MHW metrics should be defined on the basis of physics, and their 
  impacts can then be explored for the organism or application of interest.
  Finally, from the perspective of species that have evolved over per-
  haps millions of years, a 1980–2010 (or similar) baseline has no more 
  relevance than an 1880–1910 or a 2080–2110 baseline. Rather, recent 
  decades offer a useful baseline for us to evaluate the ecosystem because 
  they represent our ‘normal’. Even though the oceans have warmed over 
  the past century, we evaluate MHWs relative to a recent baseline; in 
  the future, people will be similarly interested in variability relative to 
  their ‘normal’. For example, taking the simplifying assumption that a 
  commercial fish species follows surface isotherms, that species will 
  exhibit a relatively slow shift in its mean position due to mean warming, 
  as well as relatively fast shifts around its mean position due to MHWs. 
  The different timescales of the two shifts have different implications 
  for fisheries—the slow shift would dictate changes regarding where fish-
  ing operations should be based, whereas the fast shifts would dictate 
  year-to-year disruptions in the fishery. One could think of an analogy 
  using sea level—if a beach has waves that are 1 m high and the sea level 
  rises 2 m owing to warming and ice melt, would we say that the waves 
  are now 3 m high? We argue that that would be technically incorrect 
  and misleading; characterizations of waves and mean sea level rise 
  should be kept separate so that, as appropriate, waves can be assessed 
  separately (for example, by a surfer who cares only about the wave 
  height) or in combination with the mean change (for example, by a 
  beachfront property owner who cares about the total sea level change).
