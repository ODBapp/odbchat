  A global overview of marine heatwaves in a changing climate
  Marine heatwaves have profoundly impacted marine ecosystems over large areas of the world
  oceans, calling for improved understanding of their dynamics and predictability. Here, we critically
  review the recent substantial advances in this active area of research, including the exploration of the
  three-dimensional structure and evolution of these extremes, their drivers, their connection with other
  extremes in the ocean and over land, future projections, and assessment of their predictability and
  current prediction skill. To make progress on predicting and projecting marine heatwaves and their
  impacts, a more complete mechanistic understanding of these extremes over the full ocean depth and
  at the relevant spatial and temporal scales is needed, together with models that can realistically
  capture the leading mechanisms at those scales. Sustained observing systems, as well as measuring
  platforms that can be rapidly deployed, are essential to achieve comprehensive event
  characterizations while also chronicling the evolving nature of these extremes and their impacts in our
  changing climate.

  Overview (part, about Box1, Fig.1 and conclusion)
  ... Although MHW research has primarily considered temperature extremes
  at the ocean surface, subsurface temperature extremes may be more
  intense and longer-lasting than their surface counterparts... Given the
  prevalence of life throughout the water column, subsurface MHWs need
  to be closely observed, mechanistically understood, and skillfully pre-
  dicted. In addition, while the physical characterization of MHWs has
  mainly focused on large-scale events (Box 1), MHWs are now also studied
  in more localized coastal areas, marginal seas...

  Box 1 | Historical marine heatwaves and the unprecedented summer of 2023
  Recent decades have witnessed the occurrence of MHWs that were
  particularly intense, long-lasting and impactful (top panel of Box ﬁgure,
  showing SST anomalies above 1 °C at the peak month of each MHW).
  These most prominent MHWs generally occurred in different regions at
  different times. However, the boreal summer of 2023 recorded global
  monthly-mean SSTs at record high since the beginning of the instru-
  mental record178, with a large fraction of the ocean experiencing extreme
  conditions, as illustrated by the widespread SST anomalies76 above the
  90th percentile (1982–2011 baseline) during July 2023 (bottom panel of
  Box ﬁgure). In particular, average North Atlantic (0°–60°N, 0°–80°W)
  temperatures reached levels of warming that exceeded four standard
  deviations of the 1980–2011 period during parts of July and September
  2023179, with an annual average ~0.23 °C higher than in 2022180.
  What caused this unprecedented global extreme? The developing El
  Niño in 2023 can be expected to have caused an increase in radiative
  heating due to the inﬂuence of the El Niño SST pattern on atmospheric
  static stability and low-level clouds181. In addition, El Niño can alter the
  atmospheric circulation and cause the development of SST anomalies in
  different regions of the world, like the northeast Paciﬁc110 and the tropical
  North Atlantic182, although warming in the tropical North Atlantic usually
  occurs after the peak of an El Niño event rather than during its develop-
  ment phase. The pattern of Atlantic warming is consistent with the
  negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation183, which was indeed
  strongly negative from mid-April to mid-May and most of July 2023. The
  concentration of the 2023 warming in near-surface waters180 suggests
  that upper ocean stratiﬁcation, possibly modulated by large-scale cli-
  mate modes, may have played an important role in preventing the excess
  heat absorbed by the ocean from being effectively distributed downward,
  resulting in enhanced surface warming. Other hypotheses regarding the
  unprecedented 2023 warming include a decreased transport of Saharan
  dust to the western Atlantic, and a reduction of ship emissions following a
  2020 international agreement, leading to an increase in radiative
  forcing184, although the inﬂuence of these factors on Atlantic warming has
  yet to be demonstrated. Another proposed hypothesis pertains to the
  aftermath of the January 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic
  eruption in Tonga185. This eruption emitted aerosols, which had cooling
  effects, while simultaneously releasing stratospheric water vapor, which
  had warming effects. However, these factors are estimated to explain, at
  most,amarginalnetcooling ofa fewhundredths ofa degree,ratherthana
  warming185. In addition to these mostly natural drivers, the ocean is
  estimated to have absorbed about 90% of the excess heat associated
  with global warming161, causing an average warming of the upper 2000m
  of the global ocean of ~6.6 1021J/year over 1958–2023180. Thus, it is very
  likely that climate change has contributed to the intensityand widespread
  coverage of the 2023 MHWs.

  As the oceans continue to warm with anthropogenic climate
  change48,49, deﬁning MHWs under non-stationary conditions becomes
  increasingly challenging, as commonly used deﬁnitions will lead to a per-
  manent MHW state in areas experiencing sufﬁcient warming50 (Fig. 1). In
  addition, separating the processes internal to the climate system from those
  of anthropogenic origin51,52 is key to the mechanistic understanding of the
  nature of MHWs and the assessment of their predictability and their future
  changes.
  This article extends previous reviews by highlighting the new
  emerging areas in MHW research outlined above, including: a critical re-
  evaluation of MHW deﬁnitions and their detection, both at the surface and
  inthesubsurface,inthepresenceofclimatechange;observationalneedsand
  new emerging “observing” strategies; advances in the understanding of both
  surface and subsurface MHW drivers to aid prediction efforts; compound
  events and their prediction; and investigations to assess future MHW
  projections using empirical approaches and state-of-the-art modeling sys-
  tems.Thisreviewalsoprovidesaperspectiveonnewandpromisingavenues
  for advancing our understanding and prediction capabilities of ocean
  extremes in the context of our changing climate.

  Deﬁning a marine heatwave
  Deﬁning a MHW involves multiple choices, each leading to outcomes with
  distinct implications. These choices may be motivated by the need to
  understand the physical drivers or impacts of a MHW, or they can be
  constrained by the characteristics of the available data, like record length or
  temporal resolution. For simplicity, MHWs have typically been analyzed
  using local deﬁnitions... However, since MHWs have a three-dimensional
  structure that evolves over time, other approaches are emerging... to
  facilitate the tracking of extended surface or subsurface events over time.
  Over the past decade, the majority of studies have adopted a common
  framework for deﬁning MHWs. Following the widely used Hobday et al.
  framework, a MHW occurs at a given location when daily sea surface
  temperature anomalies exceed the seasonally-varying 90th percentile cli-
  matology for ﬁve days or more (with dips below this threshold for two days
  or less ignored). The 90th percentile climatology is typically based on a ﬁxed
  reference period, or “baseline”.
  These threshold criteria were chosen in analogy with atmospheric
  heatwaves56, and were not necessarily dictated by speciﬁc impacts in the
  marine environment. As such, other deﬁnitions have also been employed,
  including, for example, deﬁnitions using the 99th percentile, approaches
  using monthly data, instead of daily data (Fig. 1), annual max-
  imum temperatures, or cumulative temperatures exceeding ﬁxed thresh-
  olds, a criterion commonly used for coral bleaching monitoring and
  prediction. Attempts to incorporate information on biological impacts
  has led to the creation of MHW hazard indices, where species-tailored
  metricswere co-developed with stakeholders using absolute temperatures.
  With a ﬁxed baseline, MHW conditions will become increasingly common
  as the ocean warms, potentially leading to a “permanent” MHW state in
  regions experiencing a high level of warming (Fig. 1). These changing
  characteristics may reﬂect the risk these events pose to some marine
  organisms, particularly those with slow adaptation rates. However, con-
  sidering a ﬁxed baseline limits our ability to distinguish the slow climate
  change-related processes from the faster processes associated with internal
  modes of climate variability or synoptic weather conditions40, with impli-
  cations for understanding events’ predictability and assessing their predic-
  tion skill66. Thus, there has been a recent call to remove the effects of mean
  warming when deﬁning MHWs by detrending temperature time series or
  using a shifting baseline period, especially for future projections...
