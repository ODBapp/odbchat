  ODB provides the open data of marine heatwave levels, as well as monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST), SST anomalies, and thermal displacements at a 0.25° x 0.25° global resolution.
  
  ## About
  
  Global warming and the ensuing climate crisis have led to an ongoing rise in Earth's temperatures. Unusually high temperatures during heatwaves can be deadly on land, and the oceans are equally vulnerable to this threat. When seawater remains abnormally warm for an extended period compared to historical average temperatures, it's referred to as 'marine heatwaves' (MHWs) ([Pearce et al., 2011](https://fish.gov.au/Archived-Reports/Documents/Pearce_et_al_2011.pdf); [Hobday et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116000057)). The MHWs can cover vast areas, spanning thousands of square kilometers and lasting for weeks or even months ([Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3082)). Such prolonged warming events significantly affect marine life, ecosystems, and fisheries. To raise general awareness about MHWs, ODB provides MHWs' open data that is compiled from [NOAA's OISST](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/optimum-interpolation-sst) data at a 0.25° x 0.25° resolution ([Huang et al. 2021](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/8/JCLI-D-20-0166.1.xml)). Following [Jacox et al.'s (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2534-z) approach, ODB evaluates MHW occurrences for each month from 1982 to the present, covering approximately 40 years (for more details, refer to the 'Method' section). The severity of MHWs is classified into distinct levels according to the criteria defined by [Hobday et al.'s (2018)](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/categorizing-and-naming-marine-heatwaves). These categorized MHW levels, as well as the monthly mean SST, SST anomalies, and thermal displacements\* caused by MHWs, collectively constitute our comprehensive global database. The datasets will receive monthly updates and are available for download. Furthermore, we provide access to [WMS](https://ecodata.odb.ntu.edu.tw/geoserver/marineheatwave/wms?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities) and [WMTS](https://ecodata.odb.ntu.edu.tw/geoserver/gwc/service/wmts/?service=WMTS&request=getCapabilities) layers for MHWs (see hyperlinks), and the [instruction](https://oceandatabank.github.io/MHW_QGIS/) for application on QGIS.
  
  According to the [2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009325844), the frequency, intensity, and duration of global MHWs have increased and will continue to rise into the future. Given the increasingly frequency and occurrence of MHWs ([Frölicher et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0383-9); [Oliver et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03732-9)), ODB aims to support research on the spatiotemporal variations of MHWs, their potential impact on marine life and provide a reference for predicting and responding to MHWs.
  
  \* Thermal Displacement: In the context of MHW, 'thermal displacement' refers to the minimum distance required to follow the long-term average sea surface temperature ([Jacox et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2534-z)). Specifically, thermal displacement signifies the range over which marine heatwaves influence surrounding marine ecosystems, particularly concerning the movement, distribution range, and ecosystem function of marine organisms.
  
  ![Marine heatwaves level](https://eco.odb.ntu.edu.tw/pub/MHW/assets/hobday_2018_2.jpg)
  
  Marine heatwaves are classified according to [Hobday et al., 2018](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/categorizing-and-naming-marine-heatwaves). Monthly SST anomalies fall into four levels: below twice the threshold, two to three times the threshold, three to four times the threshold, and above four times the threshold. These levels are labeled as Moderate, Strong, Severe, and Extreme, respectively. Figure adapted from [Hobday et al. (2018)](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/categorizing-and-naming-marine-heatwaves).

  ## Method
  
  ### ODB Marine Heatwave Definition and Calculation Method
  
  ### Step A
  
  Using NOAA OISST v2.1 dataset, calculate the monthly mean SST from 1982 to the present.
  
  ### Step B
  
  Calculate monthly SST anomalies\* :  
  Monthly mean SST (from Step A) - Long-term monthly mean SST (from 1982-2011).  
  \*The result is without detrend.
  
  ### Step C
  
  Based on the SST anomalies, define the marine heatwave threshold values by Step C-1.
  
  ### Step C-1
  
  The threshold for marine heatwave occurrence: The monthly SST anomalies (as in Step B) must exceed the 90th percentile of the seasonal background value\*.  
  \*Seasonal background value: Incorporate the month prior and subsequent to the calculated month as the background. For example, to set the threshold for marine heatwaves in February, consider the combined 90th percentile of SST anomalies for January, February, and March during 1982-2011 ([Jacox et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2534-z)).
  
  ### Step D
  
  By Step B and Step C, get the SST anomalies and determine the occurrence of marine heatwaves. If a marine heatwave occurred, evaluate the thermal displacement caused by the marine heatwave\*.  
  \*Thermal displacement is defined as the minimum distance needed to track the long-term average sea surface temperature, as described by Jacox et al. (2020). In its calculation, factors like the feasibility of biological movement are taken into account, preventing unrealistic pathways such as land crossings. The global ocean is segmented into regions with certain areas designated as restricted for movement ([Jacox et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2534-z)).
