Alexander2, Steven J. Bograd1,3 & James D. Scott2,4\n  Marine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete but prolonged periods of anomalously warm \n  ocean temperatures—can drastically alter ocean ecosystems, with profound ecological \n  and socioeconomic impacts1–8. Considerable effort has been directed at understanding \n  the patterns, drivers and trends of MHWs globally9–11. Typically, MHWs are \n  characterized on the basis of their intensity and persistence at a given location—an \n  approach that is particularly relevant for corals and other sessile organisms that must \n  endure increased temperatures. However, many ecologically and commercially \n  important marine species respond to environmental disruptions by relocating to \n  favourable habitats, and dramatic range shifts of mobile marine species are among the \n  conspicuous impacts of MHWs1,4,12,13. Whereas spatial temperature shifts have been \n  studied extensively in the context of long-term warming trends14–18, they are \n  unaccounted for in existing global MHW analyses. Here we introduce thermal \n  displacement as a metric that characterizes MHWs by the spatial shifts of surface \n  temperature contours, instead of by local temperature anomalies, and use an \n  observation-based global sea surface temperature dataset to calculate thermal \n  displacements for all MHWs from 1982 to 2019. We show that thermal displacements \n  during MHWs vary from tens to thousands of kilometres across the world’s oceans and \n  do not correlate spatially with MHW intensity. Furthermore, short-term thermal \n  displacements during MHWs are of comparable magnitude to century-scale shifts \n  inferred from warming trends, although their global spatial patterns are very \n  different. These results expand our understanding of MHWs and their potential \n  impacts on marine species, revealing which regions are most susceptible to thermal \n  displacement, and how such shifts may change under projected ocean warming. The \n  findings also highlight the need for marine resource management to account for \n  MHW-driven spatial shifts, which are of comparable scale to those associated with \n  long-term climate change and are already happening.\n\n  Overview (part, about definition and methodology)\n  ... MHWs have been defined and characterized on the basis of the local amplitude and \n  persistence of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies... To account for this critical \n  dimension of MHW impacts, which is not captured by local temperature anomaly metrics, \n  we introduce and quantify the ‘thermal displacement’ associated with MHWs across the globe. \n  Thermal displacement is the minimum distance that   must be travelled away from an MHW to \n  track constant SST. It is related to climate velocity (the rate at which isotherms move \n  across the Earth’s surface under climate change) but is applied on an event scale in which \n  the magnitude of the displacement, not the rate of change, is of greatest interest...\n  we use monthly SST anomalies from version 2 of the NOAA 0.25° Optimum Interpolation SST \n  product to explore historical (1982–2019) spatial and temporal patterns of thermal \n  displacement throughout the world’s oceans, and then quantify the future change \n  in these displacements associated with projected warming from an ensemble of climate models...\n\n  ... Several MHWs have received extensive scientific and public atten-\n  tion in the past decade, and can be viewed through the lens of thermal \n  displacement. In the Northeast Pacific, 2014–2016 brought an unprec-\n  edented MHW initially situated offshore (‘the Blob’)20 that later evolved \n  into an arc warming pattern spanning the North American west coast24. \n  During this event, thermal displacements exceeded 700 km in the Gulf \n  of Alaska and along the US west coast. Similar displacements were \n  generated in 2005 by the delayed upwelling season and consequent \n  warming... The 2012 Northwest Atlantic MHW... was the \n  most intense seen in the region in 30 years, and drove commercially \n  valuable species to rapidly shift poleward by hundreds of kilometres...\n\n  Methods\n  Defining marine heatwaves\n  Historical SST observations for the 1982–2019 period were obtained from \n  the NOAA 0.25° Optimum Interpolation SST, version 2 (OISSTv238,39), \n  which has been used previously for MHW detection9. We masked out \n  regions where OISSTv2 ice concentrations were greater than zero for \n  more than 15 days in a month. MHWs were identified on the basis of \n  methodology adapted from Hobday et al.21. For each grid cell we cal-\n  culated time series of SST anomalies relative to the 1982–2011 clima-\n  tology and classified MHWs as periods with SST anomalies above a \n  seasonally varying 90th-percentile threshold (Extended Data Fig. 5). \n  Our analysis differs from those used in some other studies in that we \n  used monthly averaged SST rather than daily data, and we detrended \n  the SST anomalies to distinguish discrete, transient MHWs from the \n  long-term warming signal31. Although we believe that the choices to use \n  monthly data and to detrend anomalies are the most appropriate for \n  this analysis, we are aware of the lack of consensus on these aspects of \n  MHW definition and detection. Therefore, in section ‘Justification for \n  MHW definition and implications for this study’ we outline the moti-\n  vations for our choices and we compare our results to those based on \n  daily data and those calculated without removing the warming trend. \n  Neither the monthly data frequency nor the detrending qualitatively \n  affect our results.\n  Calculating thermal displacement\n  For each MHW (that is, every month characterized as an MHW in each \n  grid cell), the climatological SST (SSTCLIM) for that location and time \n  was first determined by subtracting the detrended SST anomaly from \n  the observed SST. Thermal displacement was then calculated as the \n  great circle distance to the nearest grid cell with SST equal to or less \n  than SSTCLIM (Extended Data Fig. 5). Thermal displacements were con-\n  strained so that unrealistic paths through land barriers (for example, \n  entering or exiting inland seas, crossing continents between ocean \n  basins) did not alter the large-scale patterns presented here. However, \n  paths that interacted with land were allowed if they represented realistic \n  displacements (for example, along the California coast in Fig. 3a); in \n  such cases, the reported thermal displacements underestimate the \n  true distance travelled by an oceanic pathway. Regions for which a \n  displaced thermal habitat is sometimes unreachable include inland \n  seas as well as gulfs, bays, and seas that are bounded by land masses \n  on the poleward side. We note that an alternative approach drawing \n  on the climate velocity literature would be to calculate the thermal \n  displacement as the MHW intensity divided by the local SST gradient. \n  This approach is appropriate for climate velocity, a local rate of change, \n  but fails for MHW-driven thermal displacements that depend not only \n  on the local SST gradient but also on the broader spatial structure of \n  SST and locations of land masses.\n\n  Justification for MHW definition and implications for this study\n  Here we discuss the justifications for using monthly data and detrend-\n  ing SST anomalies, and the implications of those choices for the results \n  of the study. We note at the outset that they do not qualitatively affect \n  our findings; using monthly instead of daily data alters the frequency \n  and duration of identified MHWs (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data \n  Fig. 6), but MHW intensities are only slightly reduced and impacts on \n  thermal displacements are negligible (Extended Data Table 1, Extended \n  Data Fig. 7). Similarly, using a fixed 1982–2011 baseline climatology \n  instead of detrending the historical SST data generally increases MHW \n  intensities and thermal displacements, most notably in the high north-\n  ern latitudes, but produces no consequential changes in our conclu-\n  sions (Extended Data Figs. 8–10).\n  The recommended MHW definition of Hobday et al. has been \n  adopted by many in general terms, although details of the methodol-\n  ogy have been altered depending on the particular aims and constraints \n  of different studies. For example, Holbrook et al.11 used the 98th per-\n  centile as a threshold (instead of the 90th percentile) because “a 90th \n  percentile threshold resulted in too many small events that made it \n  unclear when the main event was taking place”. Using monthly instead \n  of daily data similarly limits identified MHWs to the ‘main events’. Data \n  with monthly resolution and/or coarse spatial resolution have been \n  used for historical analyses and future projections9,10,41, and monthly \n  data are used in forecasts for MHWs and other SST anomalies42–44. With \n  respect to the reference period for defining MHWs, several analyses of \n  long-term MHW trends have used fixed baselines9,10, although other \n  studies have employed detrended anomalies11,41 (we note that these \n  studies using fixed baselines and detrended anomalies share many \n  of the same authors). Thus, modifying the Hobday et al.21 definition \n  is not without precedent; it is a proposal rather than a consensus and \n  indeed the authors state “these metrics can, of course, be modified \n  to suit the specific application”. Below we outline the justifications \n  for our choices in the context of this study, addressing first the use of \n  the monthly data and then the removal of long-term warming trends.\n  We chose to use monthly SST data for our analysis for several reasons. \n  (i) The atmospheric heatwave definition requires a minimum three-day \n  event duration21; although Hobday et al.21 note that for MHWs “minor \n  differences to the atmospheric definition (minimum duration and \n  minimum time between events) were implemented because of the \n  naturally longer time scales of ocean variability compared with atmos-\n  pheric variability”, the adjustment from three days for the atmosphere \n  to five days for the ocean is not representative of their different scales of \n  variability. The atmosphere has very little memory and is often treated \n  as stochastic, whereas decorrelation timescales in the ocean can range \n  from days to over a year (see ref. 45 and references therein). Thus, we \n  argue that a minimum MHW duration of a month represents a more \n  appropriate scaling relative to the atmospheric heatwave definition. \n  (ii) MHW definitions based on monthly data are more consistent with \n  reported impacts. The MHWs identified as being the most impactful \n  historically have, with few exceptions, lasted at least a month46,47, and \n  although MHWs are generally thought of as rare events, according to \n  daily definitions they happen multiple times per year in most locations. \n  For example, in the Eastern Tropical Pacific we find MHWs once every \n  3–4 years using monthly data, which is consistent with the frequency \n  of El Niño events. By contrast, using daily data with a five-day minimum \n  duration, we find on average 1.2 MHWs per year identified in that region \n  (Extended Data Table 1). (iii) To the extent that thermal displacement \n  can serve as a proxy for distributional shifts of marine species, MHWs \n  must last long enough for those distributional shifts to occur. Such \n  ecological impacts (for example, marine fishes swimming hundreds \n  or thousands of kilometres) will not be realized in a matter of days. \n  (iv) Thermal displacement calculations are much more computationally \n  expensive than calculations of other MHW metrics (for example, inten-\n  sity, duration and frequency). In addition to being more appropriate \n  for this analysis for the reasons listed above, the use of monthly data \n  also lowers the computational burden dramatically. Nonetheless, the \n  same methodology can be applied to daily MHW definitions if desired.\n  There are physical and ecological arguments for detrending SST \n  anomalies when defining and characterizing MHWs in the presence \n  of a long-term warming trend31. From a physical perspective, we start \n  from the premise that an MHW is, in fact, a wave (or, more precisely, \n  the warmest part of a temperature anomaly wave). Using a fixed base-\n  line leads to clear violations of wave property definitions (amplitude/\n  intensity, frequency), which are objectively determined relative to a \n  contemporaneous equilibrium position. Furthermore, the proposed \n  qualitative MHW definition of “a discrete prolonged anomalously warm \n  water event”21 is violated when using a fixed baseline in a warming ocean; \n  eventually historical MHW thresholds are permanently exceeded and \n  MHWs are neither discrete (that is, “with well-defined start and end \n  times”21) nor anomalous (given that something that occurs every day \n  is not anomalous).\n  Arguments in favour of a fixed baseline for MHWs generally invoke \n  impacts on marine species, specifically that (1) they respond to the total \n  temperature change, not just the variability around the mean, and/or \n  (2) they have evolved in response to historical, not future, conditions. \n  We agree with the argument that the total warming is important for \n  species responses, but that does not mean that all warming is associated \n  with MHWs. When changes in temperature due to the combination of \n  MHWs and long-term warming are of interest, metrics such as cumula-\n  tive stress, degree days or threshold exceedance are appropriate48. We \n  also agree with the argument that species have evolved on the basis of \n  past conditions. However, different species respond in different ways, \n  at different thresholds and on different timescales, and their adap-\n  tive and evolutionary capacities are similarly disparate in nature and \n  timescale. Thus, although MHW metrics are useful for characterizing \n  marine ecosystem change, no MHW definition will pass the test of being \n  broadly appropriate for marine species responses. As is done for other \n  ecologically important physical ocean phenomena (upwelling for exam-\n  ple), MHW metrics should be defined on the basis of physics, and their \n  impacts can then be explored for the organism or application of interest.\n  Finally, from the perspective of species that have evolved over per-\n  haps millions of years, a 1980–2010 (or similar) baseline has no more \n  relevance than an 1880–1910 or a 2080–2110 baseline. Rather, recent \n  decades offer a useful baseline for us to evaluate the ecosystem because \n  they represent our ‘normal’. Even though the oceans have warmed over \n  the past century, we evaluate MHWs relative to a recent baseline; in \n  the future, people will be similarly interested in variability relative to \n  their ‘normal’. For example, taking the simplifying assumption that a \n  commercial fish species follows surface isotherms, that species will \n  exhibit a relatively slow shift in its mean position due to mean warming, \n  as well as relatively fast shifts around its mean position due to MHWs. \n  The different timescales of the two shifts have different implications \n  for fisheries—the slow shift would dictate changes regarding where fish-\n  ing operations should be based, whereas the fast shifts would dictate \n  year-to-year disruptions in the fishery. One could think of an analogy \n  using sea level—if a beach has waves that are 1 m high and the sea level \n  rises 2 m owing to warming and ice melt, would we say that the waves \n  are now 3 m high? We argue that that would be technically incorrect \n  and misleading; characterizations of waves and mean sea level rise \n  should be kept separate so that, as appropriate, waves can be assessed \n  separately (for example, by a surfer who cares only about the wave \n  height) or in combination with the mean change (for example, by a \n  beachfront property owner who cares about the total sea level change).","metadata":{"dataset":"marineheatwave","collection":"mhw","doc_type":"paper_note","title":"Thermal displacement by marine heatwaves (Jacox et al., 2020)","lang":"en","issuer":"Nature","canonical_url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2534-z","license":"Publisher Copyright (Fair use for excerpt)","retrieved_at":"2025-08-26","doc_id":"4aa0def856dfdebb205135c3a9d5a76a55110e38","tags":["monthly MHW","Thermal displacement","anomalies","methodology","ecosystem","impacts","Jacox2020","Marine Heatwaves (MHW)","海洋熱浪","海洋生態系統"],"source_file":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2534-z","source_type":"paper","purpose":"海洋科學研究提供了建構ODB全球海洋熱浪資料庫所需要的方法論，將NOAA OISST資料轉為每月海洋熱浪並指出推算出的熱位移對生態系統有嚴重影響","faq":["月平均的海洋熱浪如何定義","什麼是海洋熱浪引起的熱位移(Thermal Displacement)","海洋熱浪對海洋生態的影響"],"content":"# Usage Note\n'''\n  本文件為ODB依據Jacox et al.(2020)的研究計算全球1982年至今約40年間每個月的海洋熱浪事件而建構全球海洋熱浪資料庫的原始參考文獻。\n  在回答以下問題時應優先引用：每月海洋熱浪和逐日海洋熱浪定義有何不同、如何將海水表面溫度(SST)資料轉換為海洋熱浪事件等(列於faq)。\n  必須注意文中提供推算熱位移(Thermal Displacement)的方法，此僅為指標，並不意謂海洋生物必定會遷徙這樣的距離。\n  相關的定義、方法論、使用限制在文件中都有提到，包括時間序列資料是否要移除趨勢(Detrend)等細節，在使用海洋熱浪、熱位移相關統計值都須理解這些定義。\n  關於ODB怎麼使用Jacox et al.(2020)的研究方法，請參考doc_id: e92105f573812706c700e35c0d1eee44e62ee8cc (繁體中文版本)\n  This document is the primary reference for how ODB constructed its global marine heatwave (MHW) database, based on Jacox et al.

Alexander2, Steven J. Bograd1,3 & James D. Scott2,4\nMarine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete but prolonged periods of anomalously warm \nocean temperatures—can drastically alter ocean ecosystems, with profound ecological \nand socioeconomic impacts1–8. Considerable effort has been directed at understanding \nthe patterns, drivers and trends of MHWs globally9–11. Typically, MHWs are \ncharacterized on the basis of their intensity and persistence at a given location—an \napproach that is particularly relevant for corals and other sessile organisms that must \nendure increased temperatures. However, many ecologically and commercially \nimportant marine species respond to environmental disruptions by relocating to \nfavourable habitats, and dramatic range shifts of mobile marine species are among the \nconspicuous impacts of MHWs1,4,12,13. Whereas spatial temperature shifts have been \nstudied extensively in the context of long-term warming trends14–18, they are \nunaccounted for in existing global MHW analyses. Here we introduce thermal \ndisplacement as a metric that characterizes MHWs by the spatial shifts of surface \ntemperature contours, instead of by local temperature anomalies, and use an \nobservation-based global sea surface temperature dataset to calculate thermal \ndisplacements for all MHWs from 1982 to 2019. We show that thermal displacements \nduring MHWs vary from tens to thousands of kilometres across the world’s oceans and \ndo not correlate spatially with MHW intensity. Furthermore, short-term thermal \ndisplacements during MHWs are of comparable magnitude to century-scale shifts \ninferred from warming trends, although their global spatial patterns are very \ndifferent. These results expand our understanding of MHWs and their potential \nimpacts on marine species, revealing which regions are most susceptible to thermal \ndisplacement, and how such shifts may change under projected ocean warming. The \nfindings also highlight the need for marine resource management to account for \nMHW-driven spatial shifts, which are of comparable scale to those associated with \nlong-term climate change and are already happening.\n\nOverview (part, about definition and methodology)\n...

We masked out \nregions where OISSTv2 ice concentrations were greater than zero for \nmore than 15 days in a month. MHWs were identified on the basis of \nmethodology adapted from Hobday et al.21. For each grid cell we cal-\nculated time series of SST anomalies relative to the 1982–2011 clima-\ntology and classified MHWs as periods with SST anomalies above a \nseasonally varying 90th-percentile threshold (Extended Data Fig. 5). \nOur analysis differs from those used in some other studies in that we \nused monthly averaged SST rather than daily data, and we detrended \nthe SST anomalies to distinguish discrete, transient MHWs from the \nlong-term warming signal31.

Thermal displacement was then calculated as the \ngreat circle distance to the nearest grid cell with SST equal to or less \nthan SSTCLIM (Extended Data Fig. 5).

We note at the outset that they do not qualitatively affect \nour findings; using monthly instead of daily data alters the frequency \nand duration of identified MHWs (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data \nFig. 6), but MHW intensities are only slightly reduced and impacts on \nthermal displacements are negligible (Extended Data Table 1, Extended \nData Fig. 7). Similarly, using a fixed 1982–2011 baseline climatology \ninstead of detrending the historical SST data generally increases MHW \nintensities and thermal displacements, most notably in the high north-\nern latitudes, but produces no consequential changes in our conclu-\nsions (Extended Data Figs. 8–10).\nThe recommended MHW definition of Hobday et al. has been \nadopted by many in general terms, although details of the methodol-\nogy have been altered depending on the particular aims and constraints \nof different studies.

Thus, we \nargue that a minimum MHW duration of a month represents a more \nappropriate scaling relative to the atmospheric heatwave definition. \n(ii) MHW definitions based on monthly data are more consistent with \nreported impacts. The MHWs identified as being the most impactful \nhistorically have, with few exceptions, lasted at least a month46,47, and \nalthough MHWs are generally thought of as rare events, according to \ndaily definitions they happen multiple times per year in most locations. \nFor example, in the Eastern Tropical Pacific we find MHWs once every \n3–4 years using monthly data, which is consistent with the frequency \nof El Niño events. By contrast, using daily data with a five-day minimum \nduration, we find on average 1.2 MHWs per year identified in that region \n(Extended Data Table 1). (iii) To the extent that thermal displacement \ncan serve as a proxy for distributional shifts of marine species, MHWs \nmust last long enough for those distributional shifts to occur. Such \necological impacts (for example, marine fishes swimming hundreds \nor thousands of kilometres) will not be realized in a matter of days. \n(iv) Thermal displacement calculations are much more computationally \nexpensive than calculations of other MHW metrics (for example, inten-\nsity, duration and frequency). In addition to being more appropriate \nfor this analysis for the reasons listed above, the use of monthly data \nalso lowers the computational burden dramatically. Nonetheless, the \nsame methodology can be applied to daily MHW definitions if desired.\nThere are physical and ecological arguments for detrending SST \nanomalies when defining and characterizing MHWs in the presence \nof a long-term warming trend31. From a physical perspective, we start \nfrom the premise that an MHW is, in fact, a wave (or, more precisely, \nthe warmest part of a temperature anomaly wave). Using a fixed base-\nline leads to clear violations of wave property definitions (amplitude/\nintensity, frequency), which are objectively determined relative to a \ncontemporaneous equilibrium position. Furthermore, the proposed \nqualitative MHW definition of “a discrete prolonged anomalously warm \nwater event”21 is violated when using a fixed baseline in a warming ocean; \neventually historical MHW thresholds are permanently exceeded and \nMHWs are neither discrete (that is, “with well-defined start and end \ntimes”21) nor anomalous (given that something that occurs every day \nis not anomalous).\nArguments in favour of a fixed baseline for MHWs generally invoke \nimpacts on marine species, specifically that (1) they respond to the total \ntemperature change, not just the variability around the mean, and/or \n(2) they have evolved in response to historical, not future, conditions. \nWe agree with the argument that the total warming is important for \nspecies responses, but that does not mean that all warming is associated \nwith MHWs. When changes in temperature due to the combination of \nMHWs and long-term warming are of interest, metrics such as cumula-\ntive stress, degree days or threshold exceedance are appropriate48. We \nalso agree with the argument that species have evolved on the basis of \npast conditions. However, different species respond in different ways, \nat different thresholds and on different timescales, and their adap-\ntive and evolutionary capacities are similarly disparate in nature and \ntimescale. Thus, although MHW metrics are useful for characterizing \nmarine ecosystem change, no MHW definition will pass the test of being \nbroadly appropriate for marine species responses. As is done for other \necologically important physical ocean phenomena (upwelling for exam-\nple), MHW metrics should be defined on the basis of physics, and their \nimpacts can then be explored for the organism or application of interest.\nFinally, from the perspective of species that have evolved over per-\nhaps millions of years, a 1980–2010 (or similar) baseline has no more \nrelevance than an 1880–1910 or a 2080–2110 baseline. Rather, recent \ndecades offer a useful baseline for us to evaluate the ecosystem because \nthey represent our ‘normal’. Even though the oceans have warmed over \nthe past century, we evaluate MHWs relative to a recent baseline; in \nthe future, people will be similarly interested in variability relative to \ntheir ‘normal’. For example, taking the simplifying assumption that a \ncommercial fish species follows surface isotherms, that species will \nexhibit a relatively slow shift in its mean position due to mean warming, \nas well as relatively fast shifts around its mean position due to MHWs. \nThe different timescales of the two shifts have different implications \nfor fisheries—the slow shift would dictate changes regarding where fish-\ning operations should be based, whereas the fast shifts would dictate \nyear-to-year disruptions in the fishery. One could think of an analogy \nusing sea level—if a beach has waves that are 1 m high and the sea level \nrises 2 m owing to warming and ice melt, would we say that the waves \nare now 3 m high? We argue that that would be technically incorrect \nand misleading; characterizations of waves and mean sea level rise \nshould be kept separate so that, as appropriate, waves can be assessed \nseparately (for example, by a surfer who cares only about the wave \nheight) or in combination with the mean change (for example, by a \nbeachfront property owner who cares about the total sea level change)."}}],"artifacts":[{"id":"text_b41b75a49a08158b50dffa0dc614ae4704cf83ef","source_file":"bak/temp_uploads/mhw_jacox2020_paper.yml","artifact_type":"text_chunk","metadata":{"dataset":"marineheatwave","collection":"mhw","doc_type":"paper_note","title":"Thermal displacement by marine heatwaves (Jacox et al., 2020)","lang":"en","issuer":"Nature","canonical_url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2534-z","license":"Publisher Copyright (Fair use for excerpt)","retrieved_at":"2025-08-26","doc_id":"4aa0def856dfdebb205135c3a9d5a76a55110e38","tags":["monthly MHW","Thermal displacement","anomalies","methodology","ecosystem","impacts","Jacox2020","Marine Heatwaves (MHW)","海洋熱浪","海洋生態系統"],"source_file":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2534-z","source_type":"paper","purpose":"海洋科學研究提供了建構ODB全球海洋熱浪資料庫所需要的方法論，將NOAA OISST資料轉為每月海洋熱浪並指出推算出的熱位移對生態系統有嚴重影響","faq":["月平均的海洋熱浪如何定義","什麼是海洋熱浪引起的熱位移(Thermal Displacement)","海洋熱浪對海洋生態的影響"],"content":"# Usage Note\n'''\n  本文件為ODB依據Jacox et al.(2020)的研究計算全球1982年至今約40年間每個月的海洋熱浪事件而建構全球海洋熱浪資料庫的原始參考文獻。\n  在回答以下問題時應優先引用：每月海洋熱浪和逐日海洋熱浪定義有何不同、如何將海水表面溫度(SST)資料轉換為海洋熱浪事件等(列於faq)。\n  必須注意文中提供推算熱位移(Thermal Displacement)的方法，此僅為指標，並不意謂海洋生物必定會遷徙這樣的距離。\n  相關的定義、方法論、使用限制在文件中都有提到，包括時間序列資料是否要移除趨勢(Detrend)等細節，在使用海洋熱浪、熱位移相關統計值都須理解這些定義。\n  關於ODB怎麼使用Jacox et al.(2020)的研究方法，請參考doc_id: e92105f573812706c700e35c0d1eee44e62ee8cc (繁體中文版本)\n  This document is the primary reference for how ODB constructed its global marine heatwave (MHW) database, based on Jacox et al.

Alexander2, Steven J. Bograd1,3 & James D. Scott2,4\nMarine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete but prolonged periods of anomalously warm \nocean temperatures—can drastically alter ocean ecosystems, with profound ecological \nand socioeconomic impacts1–8. Considerable effort has been directed at understanding \nthe patterns, drivers and trends of MHWs globally9–11. Typically, MHWs are \ncharacterized on the basis of their intensity and persistence at a given location—an \napproach that is particularly relevant for corals and other sessile organisms that must \nendure increased temperatures. However, many ecologically and commercially \nimportant marine species respond to environmental disruptions by relocating to \nfavourable habitats, and dramatic range shifts of mobile marine species are among the \nconspicuous impacts of MHWs1,4,12,13. Whereas spatial temperature shifts have been \nstudied extensively in the context of long-term warming trends14–18, they are \nunaccounted for in existing global MHW analyses. Here we introduce thermal \ndisplacement as a metric that characterizes MHWs by the spatial shifts of surface \ntemperature contours, instead of by local temperature anomalies, and use an \nobservation-based global sea surface temperature dataset to calculate thermal \ndisplacements for all MHWs from 1982 to 2019. We show that thermal displacements \nduring MHWs vary from tens to thousands of kilometres across the world’s oceans and \ndo not correlate spatially with MHW intensity. Furthermore, short-term thermal \ndisplacements during MHWs are of comparable magnitude to century-scale shifts \ninferred from warming trends, although their global spatial patterns are very \ndifferent. These results expand our understanding of MHWs and their potential \nimpacts on marine species, revealing which regions are most susceptible to thermal \ndisplacement, and how such shifts may change under projected ocean warming. The \nfindings also highlight the need for marine resource management to account for \nMHW-driven spatial shifts, which are of comparable scale to those associated with \nlong-term climate change and are already happening.\n\nOverview (part, about definition and methodology)\n... MHWs have been defined and characterized on the basis of the local amplitude and \npersistence of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies... To account for this critical \ndimension of MHW impacts, which is not captured by local temperature anomaly metrics, \nwe introduce and quantify the ‘thermal displacement’ associated with MHWs across the globe. \nThermal displacement is the minimum distance that   must be travelled away from an MHW to \ntrack constant SST. It is related to climate velocity (the rate at which isotherms move \nacross the Earth’s surface under climate change) but is applied on an event scale in which \nthe magnitude of the displacement, not the rate of change, is of greatest interest...\nwe use monthly SST anomalies from version 2 of the NOAA 0.25° Optimum Interpolation SST \nproduct to explore historical (1982–2019) spatial and temporal patterns of thermal \ndisplacement throughout the world’s oceans, and then quantify the future change \nin these displacements associated with projected warming from an ensemble of climate models...\n\n... Several MHWs have received extensive scientific and public atten-\ntion in the past decade, and can be viewed through the lens of thermal \ndisplacement. In the Northeast Pacific, 2014–2016 brought an unprec-\nedented MHW initially situated offshore (‘the Blob’)20 that later evolved \ninto an arc warming pattern spanning the North American west coast24. \nDuring this event, thermal displacements exceeded 700 km in the Gulf \nof Alaska and along the US west coast. Similar displacements were \ngenerated in 2005 by the delayed upwelling season and consequent \nwarming... The 2012 Northwest Atlantic MHW... was the \nmost intense seen in the region in 30 years, and drove commercially \nvaluable species to rapidly shift poleward by hundreds of kilometres...\n\nMethods\nDefining marine heatwaves\nHistorical SST observations for the 1982–2019 period were obtained from \nthe NOAA 0.25° Optimum Interpolation SST, version 2 (OISSTv238,39), \nwhich has been used previously for MHW detection9. We masked out \nregions where OISSTv2 ice concentrations were greater than zero for \nmore than 15 days in a month. MHWs were identified on the basis of \nmethodology adapted from Hobday et al.21. For each grid cell we cal-\nculated time series of SST anomalies relative to the 1982–2011 clima-\ntology and classified MHWs as periods with SST anomalies above a \nseasonally varying 90th-percentile threshold (Extended Data Fig. 5). \nOur analysis differs from those used in some other studies in that we \nused monthly averaged SST rather than daily data, and we detrended \nthe SST anomalies to distinguish discrete, transient MHWs from the \nlong-term warming signal31. Although we believe that the choices to use \nmonthly data and to detrend anomalies are the most appropriate for \nthis analysis, we are aware of the lack of consensus on these aspects of \nMHW definition and detection. Therefore, in section ‘Justification for \nMHW definition and implications for this study’ we outline the moti-\nvations for our choices and we compare our results to those based on \ndaily data and those calculated without removing the warming trend. \nNeither the monthly data frequency nor the detrending qualitatively \naffect our results.\nCalculating thermal displacement\nFor each MHW (that is, every month characterized as an MHW in each \ngrid cell), the climatological SST (SSTCLIM) for that location and time \nwas first determined by subtracting the detrended SST anomaly from \nthe observed SST. Thermal displacement was then calculated as the \ngreat circle distance to the nearest grid cell with SST equal to or less \nthan SSTCLIM (Extended Data Fig. 5). Thermal displacements were con-\nstrained so that unrealistic paths through land barriers (for example, \nentering or exiting inland seas, crossing continents between ocean \nbasins) did not alter the large-scale patterns presented here. However, \npaths that interacted with land were allowed if they represented realistic \ndisplacements (for example, along the California coast in Fig. 3a); in \nsuch cases, the reported thermal displacements underestimate the \ntrue distance travelled by an oceanic pathway. Regions for which a \ndisplaced thermal habitat is sometimes unreachable include inland \nseas as well as gulfs, bays, and seas that are bounded by land masses \non the poleward side. We note that an alternative approach drawing \non the climate velocity literature would be to calculate the thermal \ndisplacement as the MHW intensity divided by the local SST gradient. \nThis approach is appropriate for climate velocity, a local rate of change, \nbut fails for MHW-driven thermal displacements that depend not only \non the local SST gradient but also on the broader spatial structure of \nSST and locations of land masses.\n\nJustification for MHW definition and implications for this study\nHere we discuss the justifications for using monthly data and detrend-\ning SST anomalies, and the implications of those choices for the results \nof the study. We note at the outset that they do not qualitatively affect \nour findings; using monthly instead of daily data alters the frequency \nand duration of identified MHWs (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data \nFig. 6), but MHW intensities are only slightly reduced and impacts on \nthermal displacements are negligible (Extended Data Table 1, Extended \nData Fig. 7). Similarly, using a fixed 1982–2011 baseline climatology \ninstead of detrending the historical SST data generally increases MHW \nintensities and thermal displacements, most notably in the high north-\nern latitudes, but produces no consequential changes in our conclu-\nsions (Extended Data Figs. 8–10).\nThe recommended MHW definition of Hobday et al. has been \nadopted by many in general terms, although details of the methodol-\nogy have been altered depending on the particular aims and constraints \nof different studies. For example, Holbrook et al.11 used the 98th per-\ncentile as a threshold (instead of the 90th percentile) because “a 90th \npercentile threshold resulted in too many small events that made it \nunclear when the main event was taking place”. Using monthly instead \nof daily data similarly limits identified MHWs to the ‘main events’. Data \nwith monthly resolution and/or coarse spatial resolution have been \nused for historical analyses and future projections9,10,41, and monthly \ndata are used in forecasts for MHWs and other SST anomalies42–44. With \nrespect to the reference period for defining MHWs, several analyses of \nlong-term MHW trends have used fixed baselines9,10, although other \nstudies have employed detrended anomalies11,41 (we note that these \nstudies using fixed baselines and detrended anomalies share many \nof the same authors). Thus, modifying the Hobday et al.21 definition \nis not without precedent; it is a proposal rather than a consensus and \nindeed the authors state “these metrics can, of course, be modified \nto suit the specific application”. Below we outline the justifications \nfor our choices in the context of this study, addressing first the use of \nthe monthly data and then the removal of long-term warming trends.\nWe chose to use monthly SST data for our analysis for several reasons. \n(i) The atmospheric heatwave definition requires a minimum three-day \nevent duration21; although Hobday et al.21 note that for MHWs “minor \ndifferences to the atmospheric definition (minimum duration and \nminimum time between events) were implemented because of the \nnaturally longer time scales of ocean variability compared with atmos-\npheric variability”, the adjustment from three days for the atmosphere \nto five days for the ocean is not representative of their different scales of \nvariability. The atmosphere has very little memory and is often treated \nas stochastic, whereas decorrelation timescales in the ocean can range \nfrom days to over a year (see ref. 45 and references therein). Thus, we \nargue that a minimum MHW duration of a month represents a more \nappropriate scaling relative to the atmospheric heatwave definition. \n(ii) MHW definitions based on monthly data are more consistent with \nreported impacts. The MHWs identified as being the most impactful \nhistorically have, with few exceptions, lasted at least a month46,47, and \nalthough MHWs are generally thought of as rare events, according to \ndaily definitions they happen multiple times per year in most locations. \nFor example, in the Eastern Tropical Pacific we find MHWs once every \n3–4 years using monthly data, which is consistent with the frequency \nof El Niño events. By contrast, using daily data with a five-day minimum \nduration, we find on average 1.2 MHWs per year identified in that region \n(Extended Data Table 1). (iii) To the extent that thermal displacement \ncan serve as a proxy for distributional shifts of marine species, MHWs \nmust last long enough for those distributional shifts to occur. Such \necological impacts (for example, marine fishes swimming hundreds \nor thousands of kilometres) will not be realized in a matter of days. \n(iv) Thermal displacement calculations are much more computationally \nexpensive than calculations of other MHW metrics (for example, inten-\nsity, duration and frequency).

When changes in temperature due to the combination of \nMHWs and long-term warming are of interest, metrics such as cumula-\ntive stress, degree days or threshold exceedance are appropriate48. We \nalso agree with the argument that species have evolved on the basis of \npast conditions. However, different species respond in different ways, \nat different thresholds and on different timescales, and their adap-\ntive and evolutionary capacities are similarly disparate in nature and \ntimescale. Thus, although MHW metrics are useful for characterizing \nmarine ecosystem change, no MHW definition will pass the test of being \nbroadly appropriate for marine species responses.

Alexander2, Steven J. Bograd1,3 & James D. Scott2,4\n  Marine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete but prolonged periods of anomalously warm \n  ocean temperatures—can drastically alter ocean ecosystems, with profound ecological \n  and socioeconomic impacts1–8.

For each grid cell we cal-\n  culated time series of SST anomalies relative to the 1982–2011 clima-\n  tology and classified MHWs as periods with SST anomalies above a \n  seasonally varying 90th-percentile threshold (Extended Data Fig. 5). \n  Our analysis differs from those used in some other studies in that we \n  used monthly averaged SST rather than daily data, and we detrended \n  the SST anomalies to distinguish discrete, transient MHWs from the \n  long-term warming signal31. Although we believe that the choices to use \n  monthly data and to detrend anomalies are the most appropriate for \n  this analysis, we are aware of the lack of consensus on these aspects of \n  MHW definition and detection. Therefore, in section ‘Justification for \n  MHW definition and implications for this study’ we outline the moti-\n  vations for our choices and we compare our results to those based on \n  daily data and those calculated without removing the warming trend. \n  Neither the monthly data frequency nor the detrending qualitatively \n  affect our results.\n  Calculating thermal displacement\n  For each MHW (that is, every month characterized as an MHW in each \n  grid cell), the climatological SST (SSTCLIM) for that location and time \n  was first determined by subtracting the detrended SST anomaly from \n  the observed SST. Thermal displacement was then calculated as the \n  great circle distance to the nearest grid cell with SST equal to or less \n  than SSTCLIM (Extended Data Fig. 5). Thermal displacements were con-\n  strained so that unrealistic paths through land barriers (for example, \n  entering or exiting inland seas, crossing continents between ocean \n  basins) did not alter the large-scale patterns presented here. However, \n  paths that interacted with land were allowed if they represented realistic \n  displacements (for example, along the California coast in Fig. 3a); in \n  such cases, the reported thermal displacements underestimate the \n  true distance travelled by an oceanic pathway. Regions for which a \n  displaced thermal habitat is sometimes unreachable include inland \n  seas as well as gulfs, bays, and seas that are bounded by land masses \n  on the poleward side. We note that an alternative approach drawing \n  on the climate velocity literature would be to calculate the thermal \n  displacement as the MHW intensity divided by the local SST gradient. \n  This approach is appropriate for climate velocity, a local rate of change, \n  but fails for MHW-driven thermal displacements that depend not only \n  on the local SST gradient but also on the broader spatial structure of \n  SST and locations of land masses.\n\n  Justification for MHW definition and implications for this study\n  Here we discuss the justifications for using monthly data and detrend-\n  ing SST anomalies, and the implications of those choices for the results \n  of the study. We note at the outset that they do not qualitatively affect \n  our findings; using monthly instead of daily data alters the frequency \n  and duration of identified MHWs (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data \n  Fig. 6), but MHW intensities are only slightly reduced and impacts on \n  thermal displacements are negligible (Extended Data Table 1, Extended \n  Data Fig. 7). Similarly, using a fixed 1982–2011 baseline climatology \n  instead of detrending the historical SST data generally increases MHW \n  intensities and thermal displacements, most notably in the high north-\n  ern latitudes, but produces no consequential changes in our conclu-\n  sions (Extended Data Figs. 8–10).\n  The recommended MHW definition of Hobday et al. has been \n  adopted by many in general terms, although details of the methodol-\n  ogy have been altered depending on the particular aims and constraints \n  of different studies. For example, Holbrook et al.11 used the 98th per-\n  centile as a threshold (instead of the 90th percentile) because “a 90th \n  percentile threshold resulted in too many small events that made it \n  unclear when the main event was taking place”. Using monthly instead \n  of daily data similarly limits identified MHWs to the ‘main events’. Data \n  with monthly resolution and/or coarse spatial resolution have been \n  used for historical analyses and future projections9,10,41, and monthly \n  data are used in forecasts for MHWs and other SST anomalies42–44. With \n  respect to the reference period for defining MHWs, several analyses of \n  long-term MHW trends have used fixed baselines9,10, although other \n  studies have employed detrended anomalies11,41 (we note that these \n  studies using fixed baselines and detrended anomalies share many \n  of the same authors). Thus, modifying the Hobday et al.21 definition \n  is not without precedent; it is a proposal rather than a consensus and \n  indeed the authors state “these metrics can, of course, be modified \n  to suit the specific application”. Below we outline the justifications \n  for our choices in the context of this study, addressing first the use of \n  the monthly data and then the removal of long-term warming trends.\n  We chose to use monthly SST data for our analysis for several reasons. \n  (i) The atmospheric heatwave definition requires a minimum three-day \n  event duration21; although Hobday et al.21 note that for MHWs “minor \n  differences to the atmospheric definition (minimum duration and \n  minimum time between events) were implemented because of the \n  naturally longer time scales of ocean variability compared with atmos-\n  pheric variability”, the adjustment from three days for the atmosphere \n  to five days for the ocean is not representative of their different scales of \n  variability. The atmosphere has very little memory and is often treated \n  as stochastic, whereas decorrelation timescales in the ocean can range \n  from days to over a year (see ref. 45 and references therein). Thus, we \n  argue that a minimum MHW duration of a month represents a more \n  appropriate scaling relative to the atmospheric heatwave definition. \n  (ii) MHW definitions based on monthly data are more consistent with \n  reported impacts. The MHWs identified as being the most impactful \n  historically have, with few exceptions, lasted at least a month46,47, and \n  although MHWs are generally thought of as rare events, according to \n  daily definitions they happen multiple times per year in most locations. \n  For example, in the Eastern Tropical Pacific we find MHWs once every \n  3–4 years using monthly data, which is consistent with the frequency \n  of El Niño events. By contrast, using daily data with a five-day minimum \n  duration, we find on average 1.2 MHWs per year identified in that region \n  (Extended Data Table 1). (iii) To the extent that thermal displacement \n  can serve as a proxy for distributional shifts of marine species, MHWs \n  must last long enough for those distributional shifts to occur. Such \n  ecological impacts (for example, marine fishes swimming hundreds \n  or thousands of kilometres) will not be realized in a matter of days. \n  (iv) Thermal displacement calculations are much more computationally \n  expensive than calculations of other MHW metrics (for example, inten-\n  sity, duration and frequency). In addition to being more appropriate \n  for this analysis for the reasons listed above, the use of monthly data \n  also lowers the computational burden dramatically. Nonetheless, the \n  same methodology can be applied to daily MHW definitions if desired.\n  There are physical and ecological arguments for detrending SST \n  anomalies when defining and characterizing MHWs in the presence \n  of a long-term warming trend31. From a physical perspective, we start \n  from the premise that an MHW is, in fact, a wave (or, more precisely, \n  the warmest part of a temperature anomaly wave). Using a fixed base-\n  line leads to clear violations of wave property definitions (amplitude/\n  intensity, frequency), which are objectively determined relative to a \n  contemporaneous equilibrium position. Furthermore, the proposed \n  qualitative MHW definition of “a discrete prolonged anomalously warm \n  water event”21 is violated when using a fixed baseline in a warming ocean; \n  eventually historical MHW thresholds are permanently exceeded and \n  MHWs are neither discrete (that is, “with well-defined start and end \n  times”21) nor anomalous (given that something that occurs every day \n  is not anomalous).\n  Arguments in favour of a fixed baseline for MHWs generally invoke \n  impacts on marine species, specifically that (1) they respond to the total \n  temperature change, not just the variability around the mean, and/or \n  (2) they have evolved in response to historical, not future, conditions. \n  We agree with the argument that the total warming is important for \n  species responses, but that does not mean that all warming is associated \n  with MHWs. When changes in temperature due to the combination of \n  MHWs and long-term warming are of interest, metrics such as cumula-\n  tive stress, degree days or threshold exceedance are appropriate48. We \n  also agree with the argument that species have evolved on the basis of \n  past conditions. However, different species respond in different ways, \n  at different thresholds and on different timescales, and their adap-\n  tive and evolutionary capacities are similarly disparate in nature and \n  timescale. Thus, although MHW metrics are useful for characterizing \n  marine ecosystem change, no MHW definition will pass the test of being \n  broadly appropriate for marine species responses. As is done for other \n  ecologically important physical ocean phenomena (upwelling for exam-\n  ple), MHW metrics should be defined on the basis of physics, and their \n  impacts can then be explored for the organism or application of interest.\n  Finally, from the perspective of species that have evolved over per-\n  haps millions of years, a 1980–2010 (or similar) baseline has no more \n  relevance than an 1880–1910 or a 2080–2110 baseline. Rather, recent \n  decades offer a useful baseline for us to evaluate the ecosystem because \n  they represent our ‘normal’. Even though the oceans have warmed over \n  the past century, we evaluate MHWs relative to a recent baseline; in \n  the future, people will be similarly interested in variability relative to \n  their ‘normal’. For example, taking the simplifying assumption that a \n  commercial fish species follows surface isotherms, that species will \n  exhibit a relatively slow shift in its mean position due to mean warming, \n  as well as relatively fast shifts around its mean position due to MHWs. \n  The different timescales of the two shifts have different implications \n  for fisheries—the slow shift would dictate changes regarding where fish-\n  ing operations should be based, whereas the fast shifts would dictate \n  year-to-year disruptions in the fishery. One could think of an analogy \n  using sea level—if a beach has waves that are 1 m high and the sea level \n  rises 2 m owing to warming and ice melt, would we say that the waves \n  are now 3 m high? We argue that that would be technically incorrect \n  and misleading; characterizations of waves and mean sea level rise \n  should be kept separate so that, as appropriate, waves can be assessed \n  separately (for example, by a surfer who cares only about the wave \n  height) or in combination with the mean change (for example, by a \n  beachfront property owner who cares about the total sea level change)."}]}
