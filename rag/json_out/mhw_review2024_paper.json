Here, we critically\n  review the recent substantial advances in this active area of research, including the exploration of the\n  three-dimensional structure and evolution of these extremes, their drivers, their connection with other\n  extremes in the ocean and over land, future projections, and assessment of their predictability and\n  current prediction skill. To make progress on predicting and projecting marine heatwaves and their\n  impacts, a more complete mechanistic understanding of these extremes over the full ocean depth and\n  at the relevant spatial and temporal scales is needed, together with models that can realistically\n  capture the leading mechanisms at those scales. Sustained observing systems, as well as measuring\n  platforms that can be rapidly deployed, are essential to achieve comprehensive event\n  characterizations while also chronicling the evolving nature of these extremes and their impacts in our\n  changing climate.\n\n  Overview (part, about Box1, Fig.1 and conclusion)\n  ... Although MHW research has primarily considered temperature extremes\n  at the ocean surface, subsurface temperature extremes may be more\n  intense and longer-lasting than their surface counterparts... Given the\n  prevalence of life throughout the water column, subsurface MHWs need\n  to be closely observed, mechanistically understood, and skillfully pre-\n  dicted. In addition, while the physical characterization of MHWs has\n  mainly focused on large-scale events (Box 1), MHWs are now also studied\n  in more localized coastal areas, marginal seas...\n\n  Box 1 | Historical marine heatwaves and the unprecedented summer of 2023\n  Recent decades have witnessed the occurrence of MHWs that were\n  particularly intense, long-lasting and impactful (top panel of Box ﬁgure,\n  showing SST anomalies above 1 °C at the peak month of each MHW).\n  These most prominent MHWs generally occurred in different regions at\n  different times. However, the boreal summer of 2023 recorded global\n  monthly-mean SSTs at record high since the beginning of the instru-\n  mental record178, with a large fraction of the ocean experiencing extreme\n  conditions, as illustrated by the widespread SST anomalies76 above the\n  90th percentile (1982–2011 baseline) during July 2023 (bottom panel of\n  Box ﬁgure). In particular, average North Atlantic (0°–60°N, 0°–80°W)\n  temperatures reached levels of warming that exceeded four standard\n  deviations of the 1980–2011 period during parts of July and September\n  2023179, with an annual average ~0.23 °C higher than in 2022180.\n  What caused this unprecedented global extreme? The developing El\n  Niño in 2023 can be expected to have caused an increase in radiative\n  heating due to the inﬂuence of the El Niño SST pattern on atmospheric\n  static stability and low-level clouds181. In addition, El Niño can alter the\n  atmospheric circulation and cause the development of SST anomalies in\n  different regions of the world, like the northeast Paciﬁc110 and the tropical\n  North Atlantic182, although warming in the tropical North Atlantic usually\n  occurs after the peak of an El Niño event rather than during its develop-\n  ment phase. The pattern of Atlantic warming is consistent with the\n  negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation183, which was indeed\n  strongly negative from mid-April to mid-May and most of July 2023. The\n  concentration of the 2023 warming in near-surface waters180 suggests\n  that upper ocean stratiﬁcation, possibly modulated by large-scale cli-\n  mate modes, may have played an important role in preventing the excess\n  heat absorbed by the ocean from being effectively distributed downward,\n  resulting in enhanced surface warming. Other hypotheses regarding the\n  unprecedented 2023 warming include a decreased transport of Saharan\n  dust to the western Atlantic, and a reduction of ship emissions following a\n  2020 international agreement, leading to an increase in radiative\n  forcing184, although the inﬂuence of these factors on Atlantic warming has\n  yet to be demonstrated. Another proposed hypothesis pertains to the\n  aftermath of the January 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic\n  eruption in Tonga185. This eruption emitted aerosols, which had cooling\n  effects, while simultaneously releasing stratospheric water vapor, which\n  had warming effects. However, these factors are estimated to explain, at\n  most,amarginalnetcooling ofa fewhundredths ofa degree,ratherthana\n  warming185. In addition to these mostly natural drivers, the ocean is\n  estimated to have absorbed about 90% of the excess heat associated\n  with global warming161, causing an average warming of the upper 2000m\n  of the global ocean of ~6.6 1021J/year over 1958–2023180. Thus, it is very\n  likely that climate change has contributed to the intensityand widespread\n  coverage of the 2023 MHWs.\n\n  https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01806-9\n  Review article\n  Communications Earth & Environment | (2024)5:701\n  \n  ===== Page 3 =====\n  As the oceans continue to warm with anthropogenic climate\n  change48,49, deﬁning MHWs under non-stationary conditions becomes\n  increasingly challenging, as commonly used deﬁnitions will lead to a per-\n  manent MHW state in areas experiencing sufﬁcient warming50 (Fig. 1). In\n  addition, separating the processes internal to the climate system from those\n  of anthropogenic origin51,52 is key to the mechanistic understanding of the\n  nature of MHWs and the assessment of their predictability and their future\n  changes.\n  This article extends previous reviews by highlighting the new\n  emerging areas in MHW research outlined above, including: a critical re-\n  evaluation of MHW deﬁnitions and their detection, both at the surface and\n  inthesubsurface,inthepresenceofclimatechange;observationalneedsand\n  new emerging “observing” strategies; advances in the understanding of both\n  surface and subsurface MHW drivers to aid prediction efforts; compound\n  events and their prediction; and investigations to assess future MHW\n  projections using empirical approaches and state-of-the-art modeling sys-\n  tems.Thisreviewalsoprovidesaperspectiveonnewandpromisingavenues\n  for advancing our understanding and prediction capabilities of ocean\n  extremes in the context of our changing climate.\n\n  Deﬁning a marine heatwave\n  Deﬁning a MHW involves multiple choices, each leading to outcomes with\n  distinct implications. These choices may be motivated by the need to\n  understand the physical drivers or impacts of a MHW, or they can be\n  constrained by the characteristics of the available data, like record length or\n  temporal resolution. For simplicity, MHWs have typically been analyzed\n  using local deﬁnitions... However, since MHWs have a three-dimensional\n  structure that evolves over time, other approaches are emerging... to\n  facilitate the tracking of extended surface or subsurface events over time.\n  Over the past decade, the majority of studies have adopted a common\n  framework for deﬁning MHWs. Following the widely used Hobday et al.\n  framework, a MHW occurs at a given location when daily sea surface\n  temperature anomalies exceed the seasonally-varying 90th percentile cli-\n  matology for ﬁve days or more (with dips below this threshold for two days\n  or less ignored). The 90th percentile climatology is typically based on a ﬁxed\n  reference period, or “baseline”.\n  These threshold criteria were chosen in analogy with atmospheric\n  heatwaves56, and were not necessarily dictated by speciﬁc impacts in the\n  marine environment. As such, other deﬁnitions have also been employed,\n  including, for example, deﬁnitions using the 99th percentile, approaches\n  using monthly data, instead of daily data (Fig. 1), annual max-\n  imum temperatures, or cumulative temperatures exceeding ﬁxed thresh-\n  olds, a criterion commonly used for coral bleaching monitoring and\n  prediction. Attempts to incorporate information on biological impacts\n  has led to the creation of MHW hazard indices, where species-tailored\n  metricswere co-developed with stakeholders using absolute temperatures.\n  With a ﬁxed baseline, MHW conditions will become increasingly common\n  as the ocean warms, potentially leading to a “permanent” MHW state in\n  regions experiencing a high level of warming (Fig. 1). These changing\n  characteristics may reﬂect the risk these events pose to some marine\n  organisms, particularly those with slow adaptation rates. However, con-\n  sidering a ﬁxed baseline limits our ability to distinguish the slow climate\n  change-related processes from the faster processes associated with internal\n  modes of climate variability or synoptic weather conditions40, with impli-\n  cations for understanding events’ predictability and assessing their predic-\n  tion skill66. Thus, there has been a recent call to remove the effects of mean\n  warming when deﬁning MHWs by detrending temperature time series or\n  using a shifting baseline period, especially for future projections...","metadata":{"dataset":"marineheatwave","collection":"mhw","doc_type":"paper_note","title":"A global overview of marine heatwaves in a changing climate (Capotondi et al., 2024)","lang":"en","issuer":"Commun Earth Environ","canonical_url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01806-9","license":"Publisher Copyright (Fair use for excerpt)","retrieved_at":"2025-08-26","doc_id":"2ccedb1ef0c1ade74224399ad9767a2e71f5e51","tags":["MHW","extreme MHWs","anomalies","review","ecosystem","impacts","Climate changes","Marine Heatwaves (MHW)","海洋熱浪","海洋生態系統"],"related_to":[{"doc_id":["799ebc3fe983aa3ef30b81ded189b749373d3ef7"]},{"collection":"mhw"}],"source_file":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01806-9","source_type":"paper","purpose":"海洋科學研究中的範例指出地中海區域 1982-2022 年間海表溫距平值揭露愈趨頻繁發生與極端的海洋熱浪(MHW)","faq":["如何從海表溫距平值來了解海洋熱浪的發生","Examples of Marine Heatwave Events","海洋熱浪愈來愈嚴重了嗎"],"content":"# Usage Note\n'''\n  本文件提供 Capotondi et al.(2024) 研究之圖1，由地中海區域 1982-2022 年間海表溫距平值揭露愈趨頻繁發生與極端的海洋熱浪    \n  回答以下問題時應優先引用：想了解海洋熱浪是否愈來愈嚴重、海洋熱浪的發生事件舉例等(列於faq)。\n  文獻回顧並說明了氣候變遷下海洋熱浪(MHW)愈趨頻繁與極端需要更適切的定義與方法論\n  所提供的圖1圖說指出，左側 (a)(c) 為地中海區域 2022 年 7 月的海表溫距平值地圖；\n  右側 (b)(d) 顯示西地中海（40°N以北，12°E以西至陸地）1982–2022 的SST距平時間序列。\n  圖 (c)(d) 移除了季節性與長期趨勢（Detrended），其中高於90百分位數（虛線）者可視為與背景變暖無關的強烈海洋熱浪事件\n  附註：關於Capotondi et al.(2024)的研究，在doc_id: 799ebc3fe983aa3ef30b81ded189b749373d3ef7 提供了Python程式實做。\n  This document presents Figure 1 from Capotondi et al.

Here, we critically\nreview the recent substantial advances in this active area of research, including the exploration of the\nthree-dimensional structure and evolution of these extremes, their drivers, their connection with other\nextremes in the ocean and over land, future projections, and assessment of their predictability and\ncurrent prediction skill. To make progress on predicting and projecting marine heatwaves and their\nimpacts, a more complete mechanistic understanding of these extremes over the full ocean depth and\nat the relevant spatial and temporal scales is needed, together with models that can realistically\ncapture the leading mechanisms at those scales. Sustained observing systems, as well as measuring\nplatforms that can be rapidly deployed, are essential to achieve comprehensive event\ncharacterizations while also chronicling the evolving nature of these extremes and their impacts in our\nchanging climate.\n\nOverview (part, about Box1, Fig.1 and conclusion)\n... Although MHW research has primarily considered temperature extremes\nat the ocean surface, subsurface temperature extremes may be more\nintense and longer-lasting than their surface counterparts... Given the\nprevalence of life throughout the water column, subsurface MHWs need\nto be closely observed, mechanistically understood, and skillfully pre-\ndicted. In addition, while the physical characterization of MHWs has\nmainly focused on large-scale events (Box 1), MHWs are now also studied\nin more localized coastal areas, marginal seas...\n\nBox 1 | Historical marine heatwaves and the unprecedented summer of 2023\nRecent decades have witnessed the occurrence of MHWs that were\nparticularly intense, long-lasting and impactful (top panel of Box ﬁgure,\nshowing SST anomalies above 1 °C at the peak month of each MHW).\nThese most prominent MHWs generally occurred in different regions at\ndifferent times. However, the boreal summer of 2023 recorded global\nmonthly-mean SSTs at record high since the beginning of the instru-\nmental record178, with a large fraction of the ocean experiencing extreme\nconditions, as illustrated by the widespread SST anomalies76 above the\n90th percentile (1982–2011 baseline) during July 2023 (bottom panel of\nBox ﬁgure). In particular, average North Atlantic (0°–60°N, 0°–80°W)\ntemperatures reached levels of warming that exceeded four standard\ndeviations of the 1980–2011 period during parts of July and September\n2023179, with an annual average ~0.23 °C higher than in 2022180.\nWhat caused this unprecedented global extreme? The developing El\nNiño in 2023 can be expected to have caused an increase in radiative\nheating due to the inﬂuence of the El Niño SST pattern on atmospheric\nstatic stability and low-level clouds181. In addition, El Niño can alter the\natmospheric circulation and cause the development of SST anomalies in\ndifferent regions of the world, like the northeast Paciﬁc110 and the tropical\nNorth Atlantic182, although warming in the tropical North Atlantic usually\noccurs after the peak of an El Niño event rather than during its develop-\nment phase. The pattern of Atlantic warming is consistent with the\nnegative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation183, which was indeed\nstrongly negative from mid-April to mid-May and most of July 2023. The\nconcentration of the 2023 warming in near-surface waters180 suggests\nthat upper ocean stratiﬁcation, possibly modulated by large-scale cli-\nmate modes, may have played an important role in preventing the excess\nheat absorbed by the ocean from being effectively distributed downward,\nresulting in enhanced surface warming. Other hypotheses regarding the\nunprecedented 2023 warming include a decreased transport of Saharan\ndust to the western Atlantic, and a reduction of ship emissions following a\n2020 international agreement, leading to an increase in radiative\nforcing184, although the inﬂuence of these factors on Atlantic warming has\nyet to be demonstrated. Another proposed hypothesis pertains to the\naftermath of the January 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic\neruption in Tonga185. This eruption emitted aerosols, which had cooling\neffects, while simultaneously releasing stratospheric water vapor, which\nhad warming effects. However, these factors are estimated to explain, at\nmost,amarginalnetcooling ofa fewhundredths ofa degree,ratherthana\nwarming185. In addition to these mostly natural drivers, the ocean is\nestimated to have absorbed about 90% of the excess heat associated\nwith global warming161, causing an average warming of the upper 2000m\nof the global ocean of ~6.6 1021J/year over 1958–2023180. Thus, it is very\nlikely that climate change has contributed to the intensityand widespread\ncoverage of the 2023 MHWs.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01806-9\nReview article\nCommunications Earth & Environment | (2024)5:701\n\n===== Page 3 =====\nAs the oceans continue to warm with anthropogenic climate\nchange48,49, deﬁning MHWs under non-stationary conditions becomes\nincreasingly challenging, as commonly used deﬁnitions will lead to a per-\nmanent MHW state in areas experiencing sufﬁcient warming50 (Fig. 1).
