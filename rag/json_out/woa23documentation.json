Statistical fields used in quality control (but not\nobjectively analyzed climatological means) are available on a five-degree latitude/longitude grid.\n• Available time spans and time periods\nTime span refers to the years represented in the climatological mean and statistical fields. Time\nperiod refers to the divisions of a calendar year. The time periods are annual, seasonal (by three-\nmonth periods; Winter = January, February, and March; Spring, Summer, and Fall are the\nsequentially following three-month periods), and monthly. Time spans are mostly decadal (10\nyear) spans, but also include ‘all’, denoting all data used regardless of year, and ‘decav’, an average\nof all available (year specific) time spans. An objective analysis for a specific time period is\nconsidered to be representative of that time period for the given time span. Table 1 lists all time\nspans that are part of WOA23.\nTable 1. Time Spans for World Ocean Atlas 2023\n• Available fields\nTable 2 presents the list of statistical fields and the grid resolutions at which the fields are\navailable. Quarter-degree fields represent the world as 1440x720 quarter-degree longitude /\nlatitude boxes. One-degree fields represent the world as 360x180 one-degree longitude / latitude\nboxes. Five-degree fields divide the world into 72x36 five-degree longitude / latitude boxes. Five-\ndegree statistical fields are the fields used for standard deviation window checks to filter the data;\ndata that pass these statistical checks are then used to calculate the quarter-degree and one-degree\nclimatology fields.\n8"},{"chunk_id":1,"source_page":9,"content_type":"text","text":"Table 2.

This value is used as an estimate of interpolation and\nsmoothing error.\n• The number of one-degree squares within the smallest radius of influence around each\nquarter-degree or one-degree square that contain a statistical mean value.\n• The objectively analyzed standard deviation are the resulting fields from objectively\nanalyzing the standard deviation about the statistical mean fields. Only grid boxes that\ncontain 6 or more observations are used in the objective analysis. New for WOA23.\n• The standard error of analysis is one estimate of the uncertainty in the objective analysis.\nIt is computed by calculating the standard error of the differences between the objectively\nanalyzed and statistical mean fields within the 2nd radius of influence (669km for one-\ndegree, 267km for quarter-degree). A full description of this field and its calculation can\nbe found in the supplement of Levitus et al. (2012). New for WOA23.\nIn addition to the statistical fields found in\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/woa/WOA23/DATA/ , there are two types of mask files\n(ending in suffix .msk). These files contain information used to calculate the statistical fields.\n• The landsea_XX.msk contains the standard depth level number at which the bottom of the\nocean is first encountered at each quarter-degree or one-degree square for the entire world.\nLand will have a value of 1, corresponding to the surface. Values of standard depth levels\nare listed in Table 3.\n• The basin_XX.msk contains the basin code number defined for each grid square at each\nstandard depth from the surface to 5500m. Each basin is identified by a code number that\nranges from 1 to 60. The basin code number in a given quarter-degree and one-degree\nsquare may change with increased depth level. Appendix 1 lists the geographic basin\nnames, the code number associated with each basin, and the standard depth level at which\nthe given basin is first encountered.\nXX in the above mask names is either 01 (one-degree) or 04 (quarter-degree), depending on the\nresolution used to generate the land-sea and basin masks. These mask files are found at\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/woa/WOA23/MASKS/ .\n• Available oceanographic variables.\nThe statistical fields were calculated for six oceanographic variables: temperature, salinity,\ndissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate. Due to the irregularity in data in spatial and\ntemporal distribution at various depths for different variables, not all variables were analyzed at\nall depths for all averaging periods (annual, individual seasons and months). Table 4 lists the\ndepth limits for each variable for each averaging period.\nTemperature and Salinity fields are available on one-degree and quarter-degree grids as\nfollow:\n• One-degree annual, seasonal, and monthly fields are available for 5564, 6574, 7584,\n8594, 95A4, A5B4, B5C2, ‘decav71A0’, ‘decav81B0’, ‘decav91C0’, and ‘decav’ time\nspans;\n• Quarter-degree annual and seasonal fields are available for 5564, 6574, 7584, 8594,\n95A4, A5B4, B5C2, ‘decav71A0’, ‘decav81B0’, ‘decav91C0’, and ‘decav’ time spans;\n10"},{"chunk_id":3,"source_page":11,"content_type":"text","text":"• Quarter-degree monthly fields are ONLY available for A5B4, B5C2, ‘decav71A0’,\n‘decav81B0’, ‘decav91C0’, and ‘decav’ time spans;\nOne-degree and quarter-degree Temperature and Salinity fields are NOT available for the\n‘all’ time span.\nDissolved Oxygen (and related O2 fields) are available on a one-degree grid and for the\n‘decav71A0’ and ‘all’ time span.\nNitrate, Phosphate, and Silicate fields are available ONLY for one-degree grid and for the\n‘all’ time span.\nThe ‘all’ time span for oxygen and inorganic nutrients is the time span from 1965-2022.\nFive-degree grid statistics are available only for the ‘all’ time span.\nTable 3.

Only grid boxes that\ncontain 6 or more observations are used in the objective analysis. New for WOA23.\n• The standard error of analysis is one estimate of the uncertainty in the objective analysis.\nIt is computed by calculating the standard error of the differences between the objectively\nanalyzed and statistical mean fields within the 2nd radius of influence (669km for one-\ndegree, 267km for quarter-degree). A full description of this field and its calculation can\nbe found in the supplement of Levitus et al. (2012). New for WOA23.\nIn addition to the statistical fields found in\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/woa/WOA23/DATA/ , there are two types of mask files\n(ending in suffix .msk). These files contain information used to calculate the statistical fields.\n• The landsea_XX.msk contains the standard depth level number at which the bottom of the\nocean is first encountered at each quarter-degree or one-degree square for the entire world.\nLand will have a value of 1, corresponding to the surface. Values of standard depth levels\nare listed in Table 3.\n• The basin_XX.msk contains the basin code number defined for each grid square at each\nstandard depth from the surface to 5500m. Each basin is identified by a code number that\nranges from 1 to 60. The basin code number in a given quarter-degree and one-degree\nsquare may change with increased depth level. Appendix 1 lists the geographic basin\nnames, the code number associated with each basin, and the standard depth level at which\nthe given basin is first encountered.\nXX in the above mask names is either 01 (one-degree) or 04 (quarter-degree), depending on the\nresolution used to generate the land-sea and basin masks. These mask files are found at\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/woa/WOA23/MASKS/ .\n• Available oceanographic variables.\nThe statistical fields were calculated for six oceanographic variables: temperature, salinity,\ndissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate. Due to the irregularity in data in spatial and\ntemporal distribution at various depths for different variables, not all variables were analyzed at\nall depths for all averaging periods (annual, individual seasons and months). Table 4 lists the\ndepth limits for each variable for each averaging period.\nTemperature and Salinity fields are available on one-degree and quarter-degree grids as\nfollow:\n• One-degree annual, seasonal, and monthly fields are available for 5564, 6574, 7584,\n8594, 95A4, A5B4, B5C2, ‘decav71A0’, ‘decav81B0’, ‘decav91C0’, and ‘decav’ time\nspans;\n• Quarter-degree annual and seasonal fields are available for 5564, 6574, 7584, 8594,\n95A4, A5B4, B5C2, ‘decav71A0’, ‘decav81B0’, ‘decav91C0’, and ‘decav’ time spans;\n10"},{"id":"text_c35ef395610c34420f57504a669b5321dcf557f7","source_file":"bak/temp_uploads/woa23documentation.pdf","artifact_type":"text_chunk","metadata":{"dataset_name":"woa23documentation","title":"• Available grid resolution","doc_type":"pdf_document"},"links":[{"target_id":"text_90098c604d84f579c5f9706db1b848d8d8311e57","link_type":"prev","metadata":{"confidence":1.0}},{"target_id":"text_6ba10d1bde15dcc9b2e2820f71e8130b395a7295","link_type":"next","metadata":{"confidence":1.0}},{"target_id":"table_f03529564b24bb4514530ff585766f31ebd9dc0f","link_type":"references","metadata":{"pattern":"(Table|Tab\\.|Figure|Fig\\.)\\s*([0-9IVX]+)","match_text":"Table 3"}},{"target_id":"table_06dee665104d2330b438778d9b1c4972103c16a5","link_type":"references","metadata":{"pattern":"(Table|Tab\\.|Figure|Fig\\.)\\s*([0-9IVX]+)","match_text":"Table 4"}},{"target_id":"table_06dee665104d2330b438778d9b1c4972103c16a5","link_type":"related_to","metadata":{"keyword":"temperature","confidence":0.6}},{"target_id":"text_90098c604d84f579c5f9706db1b848d8d8311e57","link_type":"related_to","metadata":{"keyword":"temperature","confidence":0.6}}],"tags":["temperature","salinity"],"page_number":11,"chunk_index":3,"content_type":"text","text":"• Quarter-degree monthly fields are ONLY available for A5B4, B5C2, ‘decav71A0’,\n‘decav81B0’, ‘decav91C0’, and ‘decav’ time spans;\nOne-degree and quarter-degree Temperature and Salinity fields are NOT available for the\n‘all’ time span.\nDissolved Oxygen (and related O2 fields) are available on a one-degree grid and for the\n‘decav71A0’ and ‘all’ time span.\nNitrate, Phosphate, and Silicate fields are available ONLY for one-degree grid and for the\n‘all’ time span.\nThe ‘all’ time span for oxygen and inorganic nutrients is the time span from 1965-2022.\nFive-degree grid statistics are available only for the ‘all’ time span.\nTable 3.
